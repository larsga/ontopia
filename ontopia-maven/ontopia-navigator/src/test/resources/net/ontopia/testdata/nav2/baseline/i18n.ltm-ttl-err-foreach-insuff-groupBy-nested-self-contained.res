<tolog:foreach> - tag insufficiently grouped or missing grouping descendant.
A grouping descendant is another <tolog:foreach> tag that is nested within this <tolog:foreach> tag and groups its result further.
A <tolog:foreach> tag is insufficiently grouped if it has no grouping descendant and uses the "groupBy" attribute to group by some but not all its columns.
