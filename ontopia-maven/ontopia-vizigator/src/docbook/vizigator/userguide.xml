<section> 
    <title>Introduction</title> 
    <para>The Topic Maps model describes the knowledge structures inherent in
      an underlying body of information. This model, which reflects the associative
      mode typical of the way humans think, can then be intuitively perused in
      different ways. </para> 
    <para>One possibility is a text-based interface. The Ontopia Omnigator (the
      name is a contraction of "omnivorous navigator") uses a form-based navigation
      paradigm that is commonly known and used by most of us every day when using the
      web. </para> 
    <para>However, often a picture or graphic can be easier to grasp than a
      wordy description. The Ontopia Vizigator ("vi[z]ual navigator") uses a
      graphical interface to provide an additional method of topic map navigation.
      Although Vizigator can be used on its own, it is also well-suited to complement
      a text-based interface.</para> 
    <section> 
      <title>Components</title> 
      <para> Vizigator consists of three components which are related/dependent
        on each other.

              designer's configuration tool</para> 
            <para> VizDesktop can be used without any other Ontopia browsing
              environment. However, it is primarily a configuration tool for application
              designers to determine whether and/or how various topic types and associations
              will be graphically displayed. This is the entry point to the entire Ontopia
              Vizigator. To get started, see <xref linkend="vd01"/></para>

            <para> All of the visualization capability of VizDesktop, but
              without the configuration toolkit, VizLet can be used within other web
              applications. To bring topic map visualization to any web site, see

            <para><emphasis role="bold">VizPlugin</emphasis> -
              Omnigator plug-in</para> 

            <para> Based on VizLet, VizPlugin can be used to visualize any
              topic currently under view in Omnigator. To find out more about navigating
              visually in Omnigator, see <xref linkend="vp01"/></para>

        </itemizedlist></para> 

        <para>Vizigator uses TouchGraph, an open source toolkit for
        graph visualization, which is maintained as a Sourceforge
        project. For further information, please see the <ulink
        url="http://touchgraph.sourceforge.net/discuss.html">Sourceforge

      <title>Scope of Use</title> 
      <para>Vizigator is designed for graphically browsing and navigating topic
        maps. It supports all aspects of ISO 13250 with the exception of merging and
        some aspects of scope. It accepts topic maps in a variety of serialization
        syntaxes. </para> 
      <para>Vizigator is used to visualize a topic map, not an ontology. That
        is, Vizigator is designed to help users understand, navigate, and browse a
        populated topic map via a graphical interface.</para> 
      <note> 
        <para>It is possible to visualize an ontology using Vizigator; however,
          it requires modifications to the topic map. One way to accomplish this is to
          create a topic type, such as 'ontology_topic' and make all typing topics an
          instance of that type.</para> 
      </note> 
      <para>Creating and editing topic maps via Vizigator is not supported at
        this time.</para>

    <section id="locsupport"> 
      <title>Localization Support</title> 
      <para> Vizigator has internationalization support for translating the
        user interface into any language. The following table lists the currently
        supported languages and the codes that should be used to designate their use
        (see <xref linkend="startvizdesktop"/> and <xref linkend="usevizlet"/>).

        <title>Viewing principles</title> 
        <para>For the purposes of this section, we will ignore the fact that
          the graph in Vizigator represents a topic map, and instead focus on the graph
          and what happens to it. This means that in general, a node is considered to be
          just a node, regardless of whether it represents a topic or an association.
          </para>
        <para> The graph available through Vizigator is best seen as divided
          into three sets: </para> 
        <itemizedlist> 
          <listitem> 
            <formalpara> 
              <title>The complete graph</title> 
              <para>This is the entire, unfiltered graph where every topic and
                association in the topic map have corresponding nodes and edges.</para> 
            </formalpara> 
          </listitem> 
          <listitem> 
            <formalpara> 
              <title>The filtered graph</title> 
              <para>This is the graph as filtered by the type and scope filter
                settings.</para>

              <title>The visible graph</title> 
              <para>This is the graph that is actually shown in the Vizigator
                screen (including parts that may be scrolled off outside the rectangle
                currently being shown).</para> 
            </formalpara> 
          </listitem> 
        </itemizedlist> 
        <para> The visible graph is always a subset of the filtered graph
          (though not necessarily a true subset), and the filtered graph is always a
          subset of the complete graph (though again not necessarily a true subset). The
          filter settings determine what's in the filtered graph, but determining what is
          in the visible graph is more complex. There are two views or modes of operation
          for the visible graph: </para>

                is a <firstterm>Focus Node</firstterm>, the visible graph is the fragment of
                the filtered graph within X steps of the Focus Node. However, the user can
                modify the visible graph by both adding and removing nodes and edges.</para>

                  Topic</firstterm>. If in Map View at the time a Focus Node is chosen, the

                  topic is designated as the Start Topic (via the topic's context menu) or when
                  choosing to focus on a previously defined Start Topic via the 
                  <command>View\Focus Start Topic</command> menu item. Only one
                  topic can be designated as the Start Topic at any one time. Returning to Map

<section id="filtering"> 
<title>Filtering Topics and Associations</title> 

<para>The <command>Filtering Topics</command> and <command>Filtering
Associations</command> menus provide checklists for including or
excluding topic and association types to be displayed.  Unchecking the
box of a particular topic type will remove all of the topics of that
type from the visualization, as well as any associations by which they
are linked to other topics. Conversely, unchecking the box of a
particular association type will remove all of the associations of
that type and any topics that are only in the visualization because of
that association.</para>

<para>For example, assume that a topic map has both
<command>born-in</command> and <command>died-in</command>
associations, each expressing relationships between a
<command>person</command> and either a <command>city</command> or a
<command>country</command>. </para>

<para>Unchecking the topic type <command>city</command> will remove
not only all of the topics of type <command>city</command>, but also
all <command>born-in</command> and <command>died-in</command>
associations in which a <command>city</command> plays the
<command>place</command> role, but not in which a
<command>country</command> plays that role. Unchecking the
<command>born-in</command> association will remove all such
associations and topics of type either <command>city</command> or
<command>country</command> that play the <command>place</command> role
in each instance of that association (and which do not play any other
roles in that view).</para>

<para>Note that if the checkbox is shown in gray this means that the
topic or association type has no setting, and that the setting used is
that of the default topic or association type. Checkboxes shown in
green or red are set specifically for the given topic/association
type. The menu will contain an item for "Default type" which can be
used to change the default setting.</para>
</section> 

<section id="stylingtopics"> 
<title>Styling Topics and Associations</title> 

<para> The <command>Styling</command> menu consists of two items to
change the randomly pre-assigned shapes, colors, and fonts used to
designate topic and association types.</para>

<para>The <command>Styling\Styling Associations</command> and
<command>Styling\Styling Topics</command> menu items each bring up
similar dialog boxes for choosing the Shape (geometric shape, weight)
, color, and font to be used for topics or associations of a
particular type. The <command>Icon</command> portion of the
<command>Shape</command> tab can be used to stipulate an icon to
appear to the left of each topic of that type. Clicking
<command>Clear</command> will clear the field and remove the icons for
the designated type.</para>

<para>Note that a type can either have a specified setting, or it can
use the setting for the default type. The default type appears in the
list and its settings can be changed just like those of real
types. There is also a button for each type that can be used to remove
all settings so that it reverts to getting its settings from the
default type.</para>

<section id="genoptions"> 
<title>Determining General Options</title>

          more general parameters:

              <para><emphasis>Interaction</emphasis> - mouse button default
                behavior is described in <xref linkend="nav"/>; this tab is used to override
                that behavior and to designate the amount of information to be displayed when
                hovering over an association.</para> 
            </listitem> 
            <listitem>

                the typing topics that should not be visible. Continuing the example from

                <command>city</command> topic type under the 
                <command>Filtering Topics</command> menu will remove all
                instances of 
                <command>city</command>, but will not remove the 
                <command>city</command> topic itself. This dialog box can be
                used to remove the typing topic 
                <command>city</command>, regardless of whether instances of the
                topic type are also removed.</para>

<section id="sect-type-precedence">
<title>Topic Type Precedence</title>

<para>
The <command>Options\Topic Type Precedence</command> menu item brings
up a simple dialog box that can be used to specify the precedence
order of topic types. This is used to determine how to render topics
which have more than one type. Topics which have more than one type
will then be rendered according to the configuration for the topic
which is comes first in the precedence order.

          Association Types of all topics. </para> 
        <para>The menu is divided into two sections. The top section has three
          options: 
          <itemizedlist> 
            <listitem> 
              <para><command>Show All</command>: In this mode, the scope filter
                is off, and none of the settings in the lower part of the menu have any effect.
                All associations are shown, regardless of their scope.</para> 
            </listitem> 
            <listitem> 
              <para><command>Loose Filter</command>: In this mode, the scope
                filter is on, and all associations whose scopes contain one of the chosen
                scoping topics in the lower section will be shown.</para> 
            </listitem> 
            <listitem> 
              <para><command>Strict Filter</command>: In this mode, the scope
                filter is on, and all associations which are in the unconstrained scope or
                whose scope contain all of the chosen scoping topics will be shown.</para> 
            </listitem> 
          </itemizedlist></para> 
        <para>The lower section contains one item for every topic that occurs
          in the scope of an association in the topic map, sorted alphabetically. If the
          scoping topics are instances of more than one type (say, if some are instances
          of "language" and others of "country"), the menu will have an additional
          level.</para> 
        <para>Choosing a scoping topic makes that scope active. The active
          scope will be saved with a configuration.</para> 
      </section> 
      <section> 
        <title>Saving and using the configuration</title> 
        <para>The current state of the configuration settings can be saved
          using the 'File menu'. </para> 
        <para>When a topic map (e.g., foo.xtm) is loaded into VizDesktop, if a
          configuration file (e.g., foo.xtm.viz) exists in the same directory, it will be
          automatically loaded at the same time.</para> 
        <para>Otherwise, a topic map is loaded without a defined configuration,
          that is, all topics and associations are visible and VizDesktop uses default
          shapes and fonts, and randomly assigned colors for topic and association type
          displays.</para> 
        <note> 
          <para>In order for configuration files to properly do their job, they
            have to be able to reference topics in a topic map. There are a number of ways
            in which this can be done, some more robust than others.</para> 
          <para>The most robust method is through a subject identifier, which
            Vizigator will use if available. Where no subject identifier has been specified
            by the author of the topic map, the fallback solution is for Vizigator to use
            the item identifier, which involves pointing back into the source topic map file
            itself. What this means is that if the file is moved to another location, the
            references may break. The moral of this story is always use subject
            identifiers, especially for typing topics. </para>

<para>In order for this to work, a number of things need to be set up
on the server side, and we will walk through them one by one. One
example of how this can be done can be found in VizPlugin for
Omnigator; looking at its source code may be instructive.</para>

<para>The first step is to make the
<filename>${ONTOPIA_HOME}/extras/ontopia-vizlet.jar</filename> file available on the server
side. Put it anywhere you want, then make the <symbol>applet</symbol>
element refer to it. Use the Java console of your web browser to check
whether you have succeeded or not. For more information consult <ulink
url="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/objects.html#h-13.4">the HTML
4.01 Recommendation</ulink>.</para>
      <para>The next step is to set up the TMRAP (topic map remote access
        protocol) servlet used by the applet to download topic map fragments for the
        visualization. This is done by adding the following to the
        <filename>web.xml</filename> file of the web application:</para> 
      <literallayout><![CDATA[
  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>TMRAPServlet</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>
      net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.tmrap.RAPServlet
    </servlet-class>
    <init-param>
      <param-name>view_uri</param-name>
      <param-value>http://localhost:8080/omnigator/models/topic_complete.jsp?tm=%tmid%&amp;id=%topicid%</param-value>
    </init-param>
    <init-param>
      <param-name>edit_uri</param-name>
      <param-value>http://localhost:8080/ontopoly/enter.ted?tm=%tmid%&amp;id=%topicid%</param-value>
    </init-param>
  </servlet>

  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>TMRAPServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/plugins/viz/xtm-fragment</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>TMRAPServlet</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/plugins/viz/topic-page</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>
]]></literallayout> 
      <para>The <symbol>url-pattern</symbol> parameter must match what is given
        in the <symbol>tmrap</symbol> parameter to the applet, so that the servlet is
        made available where the applet expects to find it. Also, the
        <symbol>uri</symbol> parameter to the servlet must be a URI template where once
        the topic map ID and topic ID are filled in, the main page for the topic can be
        found. VizLet will go to this URI when the "Go to Topic Page" option is
        selected in VizLet.</para> 
      <para>The final part is to place the configuration XTM file somewhere on
        the server so that VizLet can download it. This must be in the location that
        the <symbol>config</symbol> parameter refers to. VizPlugin uses a JSP file to
        do this, because it needs to be able to support multiple configurations, but if
        you only have a single configuration file you can just refer to it directly and
        store it on the server as a normal file.</para> 
      <para>If you experience unexpected results with VizLet, please do the
        following: 
        <itemizedlist> 
          <listitem> 
            <para>empty the browser cache, restart the brower, and try again,
              to make sure you have the latest version of the VizLet;</para> 
          </listitem> 
          <listitem> 
            <para>check the Java Console, as the VizLet will print its version
              number and build number there; and </para> 
          </listitem> 
          <listitem> 
            <para>check the Java Console for exceptions, which we would very
              much like to see in any bug reports.</para> 
          </listitem> 
        </itemizedlist></para> 


<section id="sect-menufile">
<title>The <symbol>menufile</symbol> parameter</title>

<para>
As stated above, this parameter specifies the location of a file which
describes which menu items in popup menus should be visible. The menu
file is a normal text file, of which an example can be seen below:
</para>

<literallayout>expand.node=on
collapse.node=on
hide.node=on
hide.edge=on
sticky=on
properties=off       # users never use this, anyway
set.start.topic=on
go.to.topic.page=off # we don't have topic pages
search.bar=off
</literallayout>

<para>
Menu items that are not mentioned in the file will be displayed (and
if the parameter is not given all items are displayed). The list of
menu choice names is:

<section id="sect-copy-name">
<title>The "Copy name" operation</title>

<para>
In VizDesktop the popup menu on topic nodes contains a "Copy name"
choice, which copies the name of the node to the system clipboard.
This menu choice is by default not present in VizLet because for
security reasons applets do not have access to the clipboard.
(Otherwise, web pages would be able to spy on your clipboard, or spam
it with unwelcome content.)
</para>

<para>
To solve this, there is another version of the VizLet in the
<filename>${ONTOPIA_HOME}/extras/signed-vizlet.jar</filename> file, which is
cryptographically signed. This gives the VizLet access to the
clipboard, provided users accept the certificate with which it was
signed. In order to avoid bothering users with certificates the
VizPlugin (see <xref linkend="vp01"/>) does not use the signed applet.
</para>

<para>
Using the signed applet is not in itself enough to enable the "Copy
name" menu item. To do this, use the <symbol>menufile</symbol>
parameter to VizLet as described in <xref linkend="sect-menufile"/>.
</para>

    <title>VizPlugin - Vizigating in Omnigator</title> 

      <para> VizPlugin is an Omnigator plug-in that adds support for graphic
        visual navigation of topic maps. It uses VizLet (described in
        <xref linkend="vl01"/>) to support visualization directly in the browser. Like
        the other plug-ins, it appears as a button (<firstterm>Vizigate</firstterm>) in
        the row of links at the top of Omnigator topic pages. </para> 

      <para>All of the restrictions and differences that apply to VizLet, when
        compared to VizDesktop, also apply to VizPlugin.</para> 

    <section> 
      <title>Using VizPlugin</title> 
      <para>To use VizPlugin, click on the 
        <command>Vizigate</command> link, and the current topic will be loaded
        into VizLet and displayed. To return to the Omnigator view, right click on the
        topic to be viewed in Omnigator and choose the additional menu item available ,
        <firstterm>Go to Topic Page</firstterm>. </para> 
      <note> 
        <para>For this to work, support for Java applets must be turned on in
          your browser, and it must also support Swing applets.</para>

      <para> VizPlugin will work for any topic map, regardless of whether a
