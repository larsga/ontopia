This document introduces the DB2TM module and explains how to use it
to convert relational data, whether in CSV files or a relational
database, into a topic map. It explains the XML configuration file
format, the command-line tool, and the public API of the converter.

<section>
<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
The DB2TM module can be used to convert relational data into a topic
map. It supports both CSV and JDBC data sources, and uses an XML
configuration file to define the mapping from the relational source
into the Topic Maps ontology you use. It can be accessed using either
a Java API or a command-line tool.
</para>

<para>
The basic approach of the DB2TM module is that it takes an existing
topic map (possibly empty), a configuration, and a set of relations
(ie: tables), and converts the rows in the relations into data in the
topic map. The mapping from the relations to the topic map is
described by the configuration.
</para>

<para>
The configuration file contains a set of data sources (often just
one), which can be either a database or a directory containing CSV
files, and a set of relation declarations. The relation declarations
define the mapping from each relation to the topic map ontology used.
In addition, URI prefixes similar to those of LTM and tolog can be
defined at the top of the configuration file for convenience.

<para>
This section explains how to use DB2TM by walking through how to set
up the conversion process for an example conversion.
</para>

<section id="sect-basics">
<title>Basics</title>
<para>
Let's say we have a file called <symbol>organizations.csv</symbol>,
which contains the following:
</para>

<literallayout>ID;NAME;WEBSITE
1;Ontopia;http://www.ontopia.net
2;United Nations;http://www.un.org
3;Bouvet;http://www.bouvet.no</literallayout>

<para>
We can easily create a topic map of the data in this file with DB2TM,
but to get a nice result in Omnigator we need a seed topic map
containing the ontology. Since the CSV file only contains topics of a
single type, with a name, and occurrences of a single type, the
following LTM would work fine:
</para>

<literallayout>#PREFIX ex @"http://psi.example.org/"
[ex:organization = "Organization"]
[ex:homepage = "Homepage"]</literallayout>

<para>
The next thing we will need is an XML configuration file that
describes the mapping from the CSV file into our ontology. A
configuration file that only defines our data source would look as
follows:
</para>

<literallayout><![CDATA[<db2tm name="demo">
  <sources>
    <csv path="./" ignoreFirstLines="1"/>
  </sources>
</db2tm>]]></literallayout>

<para>
This defines a CSV data source named 'files' for CSV files contained
in the current directory (that's what './' means), and where the first
line of every file will be ignored. Note that the
<symbol>path</symbol> attribute is always evaluated relative to the
location of the XML configuration file. The next step is to define the
mapping from the <symbol>organizations.csv</symbol> file to the
ontology shown above. However, to do that we need to add a prefix
declaration at the top of the file, as follows:
</para>

<literallayout><![CDATA[  <using prefix="ex" subject-identifier="http://psi.example.org/"/>]]></literallayout>

<para>
This one element says that the prefix 'ex' is a subject identifier
prefix referring to topics whose PSIs begin with
<symbol>http://psi.example.org/</symbol>. With this in hand we can move
on to the mapping of our one relation, which is done as follows:
</para>

<literallayout><![CDATA[  <relation name="organizations.csv" columns="id name url">
    <topic type="ex:organization">
      <item-identifier>#org${id}</item-identifier>
      <topic-name>${name}</topic-name>
      <occurrence type="ex:homepage">${url}</occurrence>
    </topic>
  </relation>]]></literallayout>

<para>
This is the key part, so let's walk through this slowly. The
<symbol>name</symbol> attribute on the <symbol>relation</symbol>
element gives the name of the CSV file. The <symbol>columns</symbol>
attribute contains the names we will use for the columns in the CSV
file in order. The next line has the <symbol>topic</symbol> element,
which means that every row in the relation will map to a topic. The
<symbol>type</symbol> attribute gives the type of the topics (in this
case: <symbol>organization</symbol>).
</para>

<para>
The <symbol>item-identifier</symbol> element is used to create an item
identifier for the topic, and in this case it's created from the first
column in the file. (We do this to make it possible to refer to these
topics in <xref linkend="sect-associations"/>.) The
<symbol>topic-name</symbol> element creates a topic name from the
second column. The <symbol>occurrence</symbol> element creates an
occurrence of type <symbol>ex:homepage</symbol> from the third column.
</para>

<para>
There is one problem with the mapping above, however. It doesn't say
that <symbol>ex:homepage</symbol> is an external occurrence, and so
the URL is just treated as a string. To solve this we need to declare
the datatype to be a URI. The easiest way to do this is to define a
subject identifier prefix for the XML Schema data types, like this:
</para>

<literallayout><![CDATA[  <using prefix="xsd" subject-identifier="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#"/>]]></literallayout>

<para>
Once this is in place we can add
<symbol>datatype="xsd:anyURI"</symbol> on the
<symbol>occurrence</symbol> element, and DB2TM will create external
occurrences instead.
</para>

<para>
Now that we have assembled all the pieces, the next step is to run the
conversion, and this is done by issuing the following command on the
command-line:
</para>

<literallayout>java net.ontopia.topicmaps.db2tm.Execute --tm=ontology.ltm --out=tm.ltm add organizations.xml</literallayout>

<para>
The result is the following LTM:
</para>

<literallayout>[org1 : id1 = "Ontopia"]
   {org1, id2, "http://www.ontopia.net"}
[org2 : id1 = "United Nations"]
   {org2, id2, "http://www.un.org"}
[org3 : id1 = "Bouvet"]
   {org3, id2, "http://www.bouvet.no"}</literallayout>

<para>
The <symbol>id1</symbol> and <symbol>id2</symbol> references are found
in the LTM because the LTM exporter doesn't have any IDs for these
topics, just the PSIs, and it always refers to topics using ID.
</para>
</section>

<section id="sect-associations">
<title>Associations</title>

<para>
So far we've mapped only one relation, and to get an interesting topic
map we really need to handle more relations. The next one up is 
<symbol>people.csv</symbol>, which looks as follows:
</para>

<literallayout>ID;GIVEN;FAMILY;EMPLOYER;PHONE
1;Lars Marius;Garshol;1;+47 90215550
2;Geir Ove;Grønmo;1;
3;Kofi;Annan;2;</literallayout>

<para>
The third column here is a foreign key reference to the
<symbol>organizations.csv</symbol> file. To handle this relation we
need to extend the LTM seed ontology as follows:
</para>

<literallayout>[ex:person = "Person"]
[ex:employed-by = "Employed by"
                = "Employs" / ex:employer]
  [ex:employer = "Employer"]
  [ex:employee = "Employee"]
[ex:phone = "Phone"]</literallayout>

<para>
Having done this we are ready to extend the configuration file with a
new relation as follows:
</para>

<literallayout><![CDATA[  <relation name="people.csv" columns="id given family employer phone">
    <topic id="employer">
      <item-identifier>#org${employer}</item-identifier>
    </topic>
    <topic type="ex:person">
      <item-identifier>#person${id}</item-identifier>
      <topic-name>${given} ${family}</topic-name>
      <occurrence type="ex:phone">${phone}</occurrence>
      <player atype="ex:employed-by" rtype="ex:employee">
        <other rtype="ex:employer" player="#employer"/>
      </player>
    </topic>
  </relation>]]></literallayout>

<para>
The first new thing to notice here is that we have two
<symbol>topic</symbol> elements inside the <symbol>relation</symbol>
element. The first is used to create the topic playing the employer
role in the employed-by association with the person topic. It has an
<symbol>id</symbol> so we can refer to it, and an
<symbol>item-identifier</symbol> element so we know its identity.
(Note that the content of the <symbol>item-identifier</symbol> element
is designed to match up with that in the mapping for organizations.)
</para>

<para>
The second <symbol>topic</symbol> element is mostly straightforward.
Notice how we combined two columns into a single topic name. Also note
how we don't need to specify a datatype for the phone occurrence type
since it's just a string. The <symbol>player</symbol> element is used
to create an association from this topic (of type
<symbol>employed-by</symbol>, where the person topic plays the role
<symbol>employee</symbol>). The <symbol>other</symbol> element
specifies the other role in the association (of type
<symbol>employer</symbol>), played by the topic we defined earlier
with the id <symbol>employer</symbol>. 
</para>

<para>
And that's it. The result is that we get the following extra LTM:
</para>

<literallayout>[person1 : person = "Lars Marius Garshol"]
   {person1, phone, [[+47 90215550]]}
[person2 : person = "Geir Ove Grønmo"]
[person3 : person = "Kofi Annan"]

employed-by( org1 : employer, person1 : employee )
employed-by( org1 : employer, person2 : employee )
employed-by( org2 : employer, person3 : employee )
</literallayout>

<section>
<title>Advanced topics</title>

<para>
This section covers more advanced topics in DB2TM.
</para>

<section>
<title>Other mapping functionality</title>

<para>
Some functionality of the DB2TM mapping was not covered in <xref
linkend="sect-tutorial"/>, and so it will be briefly described here.
For a full definition of the syntax of the mapping file, see the
<ulink url="db2tm.rnc">DB2TM RELAX-NG schema</ulink>.
</para>

<section>
<title>Scope support</title>

<para>
Scope is supported through the <symbol>scope</symbol> attribute which
can be used on the <symbol>topic-name</symbol>,
<symbol>occurrence</symbol>, <symbol>player</symbol>, and 
<symbol>association</symbol> (see 
<xref linkend="sect-relation2association"/>) elements. An example of
using the <symbol>scope</symbol> attribute might be:
</para>

<literallayout><![CDATA[  <relation name="nicknames.csv" columns="id nick">
    <topic>
      <item-identifier>#person${id}</item-identifier>
      <topic-name scope="ex:nick">${nick}</topic-name>
    </topic>
  </relation>]]></literallayout>

<para>
Here we use the <symbol>item-identifier</symbol> to match up with the
topics from the <symbol>people.csv</symbol> file, and the
<symbol>scope</symbol> attribute as explained above. Note that the
<symbol>scope</symbol> attribute supports multiple topic references
separated by whitespace.
</para>
</section>

<section id="sect-relation2association">
<title>Mapping relations to associations</title>

<para>
In some cases a relation does not map to topics of a particular type,
but instead maps to associations of a particular type. An example of
such a relation might be the <symbol>offices-in.csv</symbol> file,
which lists which countries the various organizations have offices in.
The contents of this file are given below:
</para>

<literallayout>ORGANIZATION;COUNTRY
1;578
1;826
2;840
2;756
3;578</literallayout>

<para>
To map this file into the topic map we would use the following
<symbol>relation</symbol> mapping:
</para>

<literallayout><![CDATA[  <relation name="offices-in.csv" columns="organization country">
    <topic id="organization">
      <item-identifier>#org${organization}</item-identifier>
    </topic>

    <topic id="country">
      <subject-identifier
       >http://psi.oasis-open.org/iso/3166/#${country}</subject-identifier>
    </topic>

    <association type="ex:has-offices-in">
      <role type="ex:organization" player="#organization"/>
      <role type="ex:country" player="#country"/>
    </association>
  </relation>]]></literallayout>

<para>
Note that it's possible to use the same child elements inside
<symbol>association</symbol> as inside <symbol>topic</symbol>. If
these elements occur a topic reifying the association will be created,
and the topic characteristics assigned to the reifying topic.
</para>
</section>
</section>

<section>
<title>Virtual columns</title>

<para>
Sometimes the values in the database are not exactly as one would like
them to be in the topic map, and for these cases DB2TM offers what we
call "virtual columns". These are essentially new columns created by
mapping the values from an existing column either using a mapping
table or a function.
</para>

<section>
<title>Mapping tables</title>

<para>
The simplest way to map values is to use a mapping table, which is
useful for handling special codes and IDs which you do not want in
your database. Let's say that the <symbol>organizations.csv</symbol>
file contained an extra column, like this:
</para>

<literallayout>ID;NAME;WEBSITE;TYPE
1;Ontopia;http://www.ontopia.net;C
2;United Nations;http://www.un.org;O
3;Bouvet;http://www.bouvet.no;C</literallayout>

<para>
The <symbol>TYPE</symbol> column here tells us what type of
organization we are dealing with, and the choices are
<symbol>O</symbol> (meaning organization) and <symbol>C</symbol>
(meaning company). However, these codes do not occur in the topic map,
where these topic types are identified with the PSIs
<symbol>http://example.org/organization</symbol> and
<symbol>http://example.org/company</symbol>. So how to do the mapping?
The solution is to use a mapping table that translates the codes into
the correct typing topics, as shown below.
</para>

<literallayout><![CDATA[
<relation name="organizations.csv" columns="id name url type">
  <mapping-column column='type' name='typepsi'>
    <map from='C' to='company'/>
    <map from='O' to='organization'/>
  </mapping-column>

  <topic id='type'>
    <subject-identifier>http://example.org/${typepsi}</subject-identifier>
  </topic>

  <topic type="#type">
    <item-identifier>#org${id}</item-identifier>
    <topic-name>${name}</topic-name>
    <occurrence type="ex:homepage">${url}</occurrence>
  </topic>
</relation>
]]></literallayout>

<para>
This creates a new virtual column with the name
<symbol>typepsi</symbol>, which will contain
<literal>company</literal> if the value in <symbol>type</symbol> is
<literal>C</literal> and <literal>organization</literal> if it is
<literal>O</literal>. The mapping of the <symbol>type</symbol> topic
then converts this into the correct topic type, and the reference from
the next <symbol>topic</symbol> element makes a topic of the correct
type.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Functional columns</title>

<para>
Sometimes the mapping from the values you have to the values you want
is more complicated, and in these cases you can use a Java method to
do the mapping. Let's imagine, for example, that the people
maintaining the database of organizations don't always bother to put
in correct URLs, so that some of the rows are incorrect, as shown in
the example below.
</para>

<literallayout>ID;NAME;WEBSITE
1;Ontopia;http://www.ontopia.net
2;United Nations;http://www.un.org
3;Bouvet;http://www.bouvet.no
4;OfficeNet;www.officenet.no</literallayout>

<para>
In this case, a mapping table is not going to help, but we can easily
implement the correction we need in Java. All that's needed is
something like this:
</para>

<literallayout>package net.ontopia.utils;

// WARNING: this class does not actually exist in Ontopia!
public class ExampleUtils {

  public static String correctURI(String baduri) {
    if (!baduri.startsWith("http://"))
      return "http://" + baduri;
    else
      return baduri; // not so bad, after all
  }
  
}</literallayout>

<para>
We can now use this method (note that it is static) from the DB2TM
configuration as follows:
</para>

<literallayout><![CDATA[
<relation name="organizations.csv" columns="id name url">
  <function-column name='goodurl' 
     method='net.ontopia.utils.ExampleUtils.correctURI'>
    <param>${url}</param>
  </function-column>

  <topic id='type'>
    <subject-identifier>http://example.org/${typepsi}</subject-identifier>
  </topic>

  <topic type="#type">
    <item-identifier>#org${id}</item-identifier>
    <topic-name>${name}</topic-name>
    <occurrence type="ex:homepage">${goodurl}</occurrence>
  </topic>
</relation>
]]></literallayout>

<para>
This will produce a topic map where the topic for OfficeNet will
have the URI <symbol>http://www.officenet.no</symbol>. Note that it is
possible to pass static parameters to the methods by simply giving
the parameter values in the <symbol>param</symbol> element instead of
a column reference.
</para>

<section>
<title>Supported data sources</title>

<para>
DB2TM currently supports two kinds of data sources: CSV files and JDBC
connections. This section describes both in more detail.
</para>

<section>
<title>CSV data sources</title>

<para>
CSV data sources are configured with the <symbol>csv</symbol> element,
which represents a <emphasis>directory</emphasis> containing a set of
CSV files. The attributes accepted by this element are listed in the
table below.
</para>

<informaltable>
<tgroup cols="2">
<thead>
  <row>
    <entry>Attribute</entry>
    <entry>Meaning</entry>
    <entry>Required?</entry>
  </row>
</thead>

<tbody>
  <!--row>
    <entry>id</entry>
    <entry>The ID used to refer to the source. Currently not in
    use.</entry>
    <entry>No</entry>
  </row-->
  <row>
    <entry>path</entry>
    <entry>The path to the directory containing the CSV files. The
    path is relative to the location of the XML file.</entry>
    <entry>Yes</entry>
  </row>
  <row>
    <entry>encoding</entry>
    <entry>The character encoding of the CSV files. If not specified
    it defaults to the platform default.</entry>
    <entry>No</entry>
  </row>
  <row>
    <entry>separator</entry>
    <entry>The character separating entries in a line in a CSV file.
    Default is semicolon (;).</entry>
    <entry>No</entry>
  </row>
  <row>
    <entry>quoting</entry>
    <entry>The character used to quote text strings in the CSV files.
    Default is doublequote (").</entry>
    <entry>No</entry>
  </row>
  <row>
    <entry>ignoreFirstLines</entry>
    <entry>The number of lines to ignore at the beginning of the file.
    Defaults to 0.</entry>
    <entry>No</entry>
  </row>
</tbody>
</tgroup>
</informaltable>

<para>Note that quoting characters in text strings are escaped by
repeating them. In other words, if you use (") to quote your strings,
and you want to put a " in a string, write it as "". Below is an
example:</para>

<literallayout>
40;"Foo";"This is a ""real"" example"
</literallayout>
</section>

<section>
<title>JDBC data sources</title>

<para>
JDBC data sources are configured with the <symbol>jdbc</symbol>
element, which represents a database containing a set of tables.  The
attributes accepted by this element are listed in the table below.
</para>

<informaltable>
<tgroup cols="2">
<thead>
  <row>
    <entry>Attribute</entry>
    <entry>Meaning</entry>
    <entry>Required?</entry>
  </row>
</thead>

<tbody>
  <!--row>
    <entry>id</entry>
    <entry>The ID used to refer to the source. Currently not in
    use.</entry>
    <entry>No</entry>
  </row-->
  <row>
    <entry>propfile</entry>
    <entry>The path to the RDBMS properties file that tells DB2TM how
    to connect to the database. This property file uses the same set
    of properties as the Ontopia RDBMS backend does (except that it
    doesn't make use of all the properties that tune the backend cache
    etc). The path is relative to the location of the XML file. (If no
    file is found, DB2TM tries to load it from the classpath.)</entry>
    <entry>Yes</entry>
  </row>
</tbody>
</tgroup>
</informaltable>

<para>
Note that the JDBC source requires a number of things in order to
work. The JDBC drivers you wish to use have to be on the classpath,
the database server has to be running, the username/password has to be
correct, etc.
</para>
</section> 
</section>

<section id="sect-api">
<title>Using the API</title>

<para> 
In addition to the command-line interface DB2TM also has an API
that can be used to run conversions and synchronizations in other
contexts than on the command-line. This API is very simple and
consists of the single class
<classname>net.ontopia.topicmaps.db2tm.DB2TM</classname>, which has two
methods: <methodname>add</methodname> and
<methodname>sync</methodname>. The <methodname>add</methodname> method
can run conversions given a string reference to a configuration file
and a topic map. The <methodname>sync</methodname> method can perform
synchronizations given a string reference to a configuration file and
a topic map to synchronize against.  
</para>

<para>
A command-line Java program that runs the same conversion that we saw
in <xref linkend="sect-basics"/> could be written as follows:
</para>

<literallayout>import net.ontopia.topicmaps.core.TopicMapIF;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.ImportExportUtils;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.db2tm.DB2TM;

public class Convert {

  public static void main(String argv[]) throws java.io.IOException {
    TopicMapIF topicmap = ImportExportUtils.getReader("ontology.ltm").read();
    DB2TM.add("organizations.xml", topicmap);
    ImportExportUtils.getWriter("tm.ltm").write(topicmap);
  }
}</literallayout>


<para>
Here is a simple command-line Java program that performs synchronization:
</para>

<literallayout>import net.ontopia.topicmaps.core.TopicMapIF;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.utils.ImportExportUtils;
import net.ontopia.topicmaps.db2tm.DB2TM;

public class Synchronize {

  public static void main(String argv[]) throws java.io.IOException {
    TopicMapIF topicmap = ImportExportUtils.getReader("ontology.ltm").read();
    DB2TM.sync("organizations.xml", topicmap);
    ImportExportUtils.getWriter("tm.ltm").write(topicmap);
  }
}</literallayout>

</section>

<section>
<title>Using the command-line tool with RDBMS topic maps</title>

<para>
So far, the examples have shown only running DB2TM against topic maps
stored in files. In practice, most topic maps will be stored using the
RDBMS backend, and so we will here show how to use it with such topic
maps. When using the RDBMS backend, there are two pieces of
information that the command-line tool needs:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>The RDBMS properties file, which tells DB2TM how to connect
    to the database.</para>
  </listitem>
  <listitem>
    <para>The ID of the within the database topic map to
    update.</para>
  </listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
There is a special URI syntax that can be used in place of a file
reference to provide the topic map ID, and a system property which can
be used to reference the RDBMS properties file. Using both would look
like this:
</para>

<literallayout>java -Xmx512M -Dnet.ontopia.topicmaps.impl.rdbms.PropertyFile=<emphasis>rdbms.props</emphasis> net.ontopia.topicmaps.db2tm.Execute --tm=x-ontopia:tm-rdbms:<emphasis>id</emphasis> sync <emphasis>mapping-file.xml</emphasis></literallayout>
</section>
</section>

<!--=======================================================================
    SYNCHRONIZATION                                                     -->
<section>
<title>Synchronization</title>

<para>
So far, we have only discussed how to use DB2TM for conversion, but if
the data source you are converting from is going to continue to be
updated, then this is not very interesting. However, after the initial
conversion DB2TM can also update your topic map so that it remains in
sync with the data source.
</para>

<section>
<title>Basics</title>

<para>
Let's say that we change the LTM topic map we produced in <xref
linkend="sect-basics"/> to the following:
</para>

<literallayout>[org1 : id1 = "Ontopia"]
   {org1, id2, "http://www.ontopia.net"}
located-in(ontopia : located, oslo : location)   
[org2 : id1 = "United Nations"]
   {org2, id2, "http://www.un.org"}
[org3 : id1 = "Bouvet"]
   {org3, id2, "http://www.bouvet.no"}</literallayout>

<para>
The change here is that we added an association for Ontopia. At the
same time, we've changed the CSV file as follows:

<para>
Here we have deleted the United Nations, added OfficeNet, and changed
Ontopia's name to end in "AS". We now run DB2TM with this command:
</para>

<literallayout>java net.ontopia.topicmaps.db2tm.Execute --tm=tm.ltm --out=sync.ltm sync organizations.xml</literallayout>

<para>
The result is the LTM fragment below:
</para>

<!-- FIXME: what about the ID references here? -->

<literallayout>[org1 : id1 = "Ontopia AS"]
   {org1, id2, [[http://www.ontopia.net]]}
located-in(org1 : located, oslo : location )   
[org3 : id1 = "Bouvet"]
   {org3, id2, [[http://www.bouvet.no]]}
[org4 : id1 = "OfficeNet"]
   {org4, id2, [[http://www.officenet.no]]}</literallayout>

<para>
As you can see, we have gotten all the changes in the CSV file into
the topic map without losing any of the changes we made in the LTM.
This is because DB2TM only synchronizes the topics and characteristics
it has mappings for, and it leaves everything else alone. There is one
problem, however, which we'll discuss in the next section.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Changelog tables</title>

<para>
A problem with the approach taken in the previous section is that it
requires reading the entire table when synchronizing. Of course, when
there are only 3 rows, this isn't much of a problem, but when there
are, say, 50,000 rows, things are rather different. Rescanning the
entire table gets costly in this case, and so DB2TM provides an
alternative approach, which is to use a changelog table.
</para>

<para>
A changelog table is basically a table that contains an entry for
every change made to the master table. For DB2TM to be able to make
use of the table it has to contain a primary key reference to the
changed row in the master table, a column by which the changes can be
ordered, and a column that gives the nature of the change. It can
contain other information as well, but DB2TM will ignore this.
</para>

<para>
Let's assume that we want to repeat what we did in the previous
section, but this time using a changelog table. To do that we need to
make a new CSV file which describes the changes. This file might look
as follows:
</para>

<literallayout>ID;CHANGE;ORDER
2;D;1
1;C;2
4;A;3
</literallayout>

<para>
The first row here refers to the row with ID 2 from <xref
linkend="sect-basics"/> (that is, to the United Nations row), and the
second column says it was deleted. The last column is there to tell us
in what order the changes happen. We are using numbers here, but
timestamps would work just as well, as long as we can sort on the
values. The second row refers to Ontopia, and says the row was
changed somehow. (The name changed.) Finally, the third row says that
a new row with ID 4 has been added. This gives DB2TM the information
it needs to do the updates correctly without reading the entire table.
</para>

<para>
So what would we need to do to make use of this? The only thing we
need to change is that we have to add the following inside the
<symbol>relation</symbol> element, at the very end:
</para>

<literallayout><![CDATA[
<changelog table="organization-changes.csv"
           primary-key="ID"
           action-column="ACTION"
           order-column="ORDER">
  <action value="D" type="delete"/>
  <action value="C" type="update"/>
  <action value="A" type="create"/>
</changelog>
]]></literallayout>

<para>
This element tells DB2TM where the changelog is, which column contains
the primary key reference, which column tells it what the change is,
and finally what column to order the changes by. The three
<symbol>action</symbol> elements map the values in the action column
to change types that DB2TM understands. (Note that a fourth possible
change type is <symbol>ignore</symbol>.)
</para>

<para>
Running the sync again would give the same result as in the previous
section, except that changelog tables are not supported for the CSV
data source. We have used CSV to explain it here for simplicity, but
currently you need to use a database for this to work. (The rationale
is that the speedup for a CSV file is very limited, since one has to
read the entire CSV file even if only a few rows have changed.)
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Secondary relations</title>

<para>
Let's say we had another table with information about our
organizations, for example references to external web sites that have
articles about them. Each row in this table would map to an
<symbol>article-about</symbol> occurrence, and the table might look
like this:
</para>

<literallayout>ID;URL
1;http://www.ligent.net/company.jsp?id=107&amp;bundle=162
1;http://www.techquila.com/topicmaps/tmworld/11770.html
1;http://www.knowledge-synergy.com/partner/partner.html#ontopia
2;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations
2;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations/index.html?inline=nyt-org</literallayout>

<para>
Doing a conversion from this would be straightforward, but on doing a
sync we would run into problems. There are no articles about Bouvet in
the table, and so DB2TM would delete Bouvet from the topic map, since
the row for Bouvet is gone. Of course, this is wrong, but DB2TM does
not know that the main organization table is where organizations are
stored, and not here. So we need to tell it, and this is what the
<symbol>primary</symbol> attribute is for. Using that, the mapping
would look as follows:
</para>

<literallayout><![CDATA[
  <relation name="articles.csv" columns="id url">
    <topic primary="false">
      <item-identifier>#org${id}</item-identifier>
      <occurrence type="ex:article-about">${url}</occurrence>
    </topic>
  </relation>
]]></literallayout>
</section>

<section>
<title>Incomplete mappings</title>

<para>
In some cases the table you are mapping may not contain all topics of
the type they map to, and in this case the rescanning strategy can get
it wrong. Let's say that, for whatever reason, in addition to the
organizations coming from the CSV file we need to add some manually.
If we did this, the first sync would delete all the manually added
organizations, because they are not found in the CSV file, and so the
rescan assumes they have been deleted.
</para>

<para>
To solve this, you need to tell DB2TM which topics in the topic map
were created from the CSV file. One way to do this is to include a
unary association in the mapping that says the organization comes from
the database. This would mean that every topic created from the CSV
file would look like this:
</para>

<literallayout>[ontopia : organization = "Ontopia"]
stored-in-db(ontopia : stored)</literallayout>

<para>
This is enough that we could distinguish these topics from the
manually added ones, if we write the mapping like this:
</para>

<literallayout><![CDATA[
    <topic type="ex:organization">
      <extent query="direct-instance-of($T, ex:organization),
                     ex:stored-in-db($T : ex:stored)?"/>
      <item-identifier>#org${id}</item-identifier>
      <topic-name>${name}</topic-name>
      <occurrence type="ex:homepage">${url}</occurrence>

      <!-- static unary marker association -->
      <player atype="ex:stored-in-db" rtype="ex:stored"/>      
    </topic>
]]></literallayout>

<para>
The <symbol>extent</symbol> element defines a query that produces all
topics in the topic map created from this table mapping. This enables
DB2TM to recognize manually created organization topics, and not
delete them.
</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>Synchronization in web applications</title>

<para>
In general it is not recommended to use the command-line tool to
synchronize topic maps while a web application is running, since
Ontopia's object cache inside the web application will not notice
changes made by the command-line tool. (This will change once
clustering support arrives.) Instead, the synchronization should be
run from inside the web server. There are three ways to do this:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>Set up the synchronization servlet to run the
    synchronization at regular intervals. The servlet is documented in
    the javadoc for the DB2TM package.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Use the Ontopoly plug-in to run the synchronization
    manually.  This plug-in is not yet part of Ontopia, but is
    available on request.</para>
  </listitem>

  <listitem>
    <para>Write your own code to run the synchronization using the
    DB2TM API. For more information, see <xref linkend="sect-api"/>.</para>

<section id="sect-tutorial">
<title>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</title>

<section>
<title>How do I add a new column to an existing relation?</title>

<para>Lets say that we have a table called
<symbol>organizations</symbol>, with the mapping below, and that we
have already added the contents of this relation into the topic
map.</para>

<literallayout><![CDATA[  <relation name="organizations" columns="id name url">
    <topic type="ex:organization">
      <subject-identifier>http://example.org/organization/${id}</subject-identifier>
      <topic-name>${name}</topic-name>
      <occurrence type="ex:homepage">${url}</occurrence>
    </topic>
  </relation>]]></literallayout>

<para>This means that all the data in the relation have already been
mapped to topics and characteristics in the topic map. The problem is
now that we cannot just add a new column to the mapping as DB2TM
would not be able to detect that a new column had been added. DB2TM
will not detect the new column and the data in the column will not be
added to the topic map before the individual rows in gets updated and
the row contents is reread through synchronization.</para>

<para>Fortunately there is a way to get DB2TM to read the content of
the new column. To do this we need to create a new temporary mapping
file with just this single relation. We'll use this new mapping file
just for the purpose of adding the characteristic(s) mapped to the new
column.</para>

<para>Lets say that the <symbol>organizations</symbol> table has a new
column called <symbol>phone</symbol> and that we want to map this
column to an internal occurrence of type
<symbol>ex:phone</symbol>. The <symbol>organizations</symbol> table
has one row per organization, so there is a <symbol>topic</symbol>
element mapping these organizations to topics in the topic map. The
temporary mapping file also needs this element, but this time with
only two fields: one field to identify the topic and one field to add
the new characteristic. In our case the relation mapping should look
like this:</para>

<literallayout><![CDATA[  <relation name="organizations" columns="id name url phone">
    <topic>
      <subject-identifier>http://example.org/organization/${id}</subject-identifier>
      <occurrence type="ex:phone">${phone}</occurrence>
    </topic>
  </relation>]]></literallayout>

<para>Note that the new <symbol>phone</symbol> is now in the list of
table columns. We now also have a <symbol>subject-identifier</symbol>
field so that we can look up the existing topic, and finally the
<symbol>occurrence</symbol> field to add the new internal
occurrence.</para>

<para>The prefix declarations and the data sources can be the same as
in the original mapping file, so just copy and paste those from the
original mapping file.</para>

<warning><para>Before we proceed make sure that you shut down your
application so that cache inconsistency issues do not
arise.</para></warning>

<para>We can now have DB2TM add the contents of the new column to the
topic map by running the following command.</para>

<literallayout><![CDATA[  java net.ontopia.topicmaps.db2tm.Execute --relations=organizations add temporary.xml]]></literallayout>

<para>The organizations in the topic map should now have their
respective phone numbers added. The next thing we need to do is update
the original mapping file. Add the new <symbol>phone</symbol> column
to the list of table columns and the new <symbol>occurrence</symbol>
field to the relation mapping.</para>

<literallayout><![CDATA[  <relation name="organizations" columns="id name url phone">
    <topic type="ex:organization">
      <subject-identifier>http://example.org/organization/${id}</subject-identifier>
      <topic-name>${name}</topic-name>
      <occurrence type="ex:homepage">${url}</occurrence>
      <occurrence type="ex:phone">${phone}</occurrence>
    </topic>
  </relation>]]></literallayout>

<para>We are now done with the temporary mapping file and it can be
discarded. The application can now be restarted.</para>

<section>
<title>How to delete objects that were added to the topic map by DB2TM?</title>

<para>The <symbol>net.ontopia.topicmaps.cmdlineutils.TologDelete</symbol>
command-line utility is very useful for this purpose. Just hand it a
tolog query and it will delete the objects returned by the
query.</para>

<para>Alternatively, you can use tolog updates in the query plug-in in
Omnigator, where you just run a DELETE statement to remove whatever
you want to remove.</para>
</section>

<section>
<title>How do I remove data in the topic map that originates from an old column?</title>

<para>Use the tolog delete utility described above.</para>

</section>

<section>
<title>Oops, I made a mistake in the DB2TM mapping. How do I repair the topic map?</title>

<para>Doing a <symbol>rescan</symbol> or <symbol>add</symbol> on the
relation together with the tolog delete utility mentioned above will
allow you to repair most mistakes. Note that you can override the
synchronization type without modifying the mapping file by passing the
<symbol>--force-rescan</symbol> option to the
<symbol>net.ontopia.topicmaps.db2tm.Execute</symbol> command line
utility.</para>
