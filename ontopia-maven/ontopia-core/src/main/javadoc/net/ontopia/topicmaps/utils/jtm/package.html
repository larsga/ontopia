This package provides support for the JSON Topic Map
Notation (or JTM) format for topic maps. Using this format it is
possible to quickly and easily exchange topic maps with web applications.
This package consists of a TopicMapReaderIF implementation, which can
import JTM files into the object model, as well as a TopicMapWriterIF 
implementation, which serializes Topic Map Constructs into JTM fragments.
