 * subjects may be the same even if their locators are very
 * different.</p>
 *
 * In general, the determination of equality between addressable
 * subjects cannot be fully guaranteed, and applications using this
 * API will need to be aware of their limitations and capabilities in
 * this respect - and that other topic map applications they
 * communicate with may have lesser or greater powers to determine
 * subject identity.</p>
