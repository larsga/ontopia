/**
<p>
This package provides support for the textual Linear Topic Map
Notation (or LTM) format for topic maps. Using this format it is
possible to quickly and easily write topic maps in a text editor.
This package consists of a TopicMapReaderIF implementation, which can
import LTM files into the object model.
</p>

<p>
Note that quite a few of the classes in this package are generated
automatically by the ANTLR compiler construction tool. The ones that
are meant to be used outside this package are marked with PUBLIC.
