<!-- ===== INTRODUCTION ========================================================== -->
<section>
<title>Introduction</title>

<para>
RTM is a vocabulary that can be used to describe the mapping of an RDF
vocabulary to topic maps in such a way that RDF data using that
vocabulary can be converted automatically to topic maps. This allows
RDF vocabularies to be used both as RDF vocabularies and as topic map
vocabularies.
</para>

<para>
The vocabulary annotates RDF properties to indicate which topic map
construct the property is to be mapped to. The type and scope of the
resulting construct can be controlled, and for associations the role
played by the subject and the object must be indicated. The RTM
mapping declarations can be stored as part of the data to be mapped,
or it can be stored externally.
</para>

<para>
The background and rationale for the design of this vocabulary can be
found in the paper <ulink
url="http://www.ontopia.net/topicmaps/materials/tmrdf.html">Living
with topic maps and RDF</ulink>.
</para>
</section>


<!-- ===== THE VOCABULARY ======================================================== -->
<section>
<title>The vocabulary</title>

<para>
Throughout this document the convention <symbol>rtm:foo</symbol>
should be taken to mean the URI reference
<symbol>http://psi.ontopia.net/rdf2tm/#foo</symbol>. Each of these URI
references are published subject identifiers that together make up the
RTM vocabulary.
</para>

<para>
RTM consists of the following RDF properties, as well as the
individual resources defined in <xref linkend="sect-algorithm"/>. The
subjects of statements using these properties are always RDF
properties whose mapping to topic maps is to be described.
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<formalpara><title>rtm:maps-to</title>
<para>This property defines which topic map construct an RDF property
is converted to during RDF-to-topic map mapping.  RDF properties for
which no <symbol>rtm:maps-to</symbol> statement is found are
ignored. The possible values of this predicate are enumerated in <xref
linkend="sect-algorithm"/>.</para>
</formalpara>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<formalpara><title>rtm:type</title>
<para>This property is used to override the default type otherwise
assigned to topic map constructs created by the mapping.</para>
</formalpara>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<formalpara><title>rtm:in-scope</title>
<para>This property is used to add a topic to the scope of topic map
constructs created by the mapping.</para>
</formalpara>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<formalpara><title>rtm:subject-role</title>
<para>This property is used to indicate the association role type
played by the subject of an RDF statement mapped to an association.</para>
</formalpara>
</listitem>

<listitem>
<formalpara><title>rtm:object-role</title>
<para>This property is used to indicate the association role type
played by the object of an RDF statement mapped to an
association.</para>
</formalpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>


<!-- ===== THE ALGORITHM ========================================================= -->
<section id="sect-algorithm">
<title>The mapping algorithm</title>

<para>
The input to the mapping consists of:
</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<para>An RDF model containing the data to be mapped to a topic map,
known as the <firstterm>input model</firstterm>.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>An RDF model containing the mapping information, known as the
<firstterm>mapping model</firstterm>. This may be the same model as
the input model, but need not be.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>The topic map into which the data is to be mapped. It may be
empty, but need not be.</para>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>
For precision, the topic map is here described as an instance of the
Topic Maps Data Model defined in <xref linkend="tmdm"/>, while the RDF
models are described as RDF graphs, as defined by <xref
linkend="rdfdm"/>.
</para>

<para>
The mapping is done by traversing all the triples in the input model
and for each triple:
</para>

<orderedlist>
<listitem>
<para>Let <symbol>s1</symbol> be the subject of that triple,
<symbol>p1</symbol> the predicate, and <symbol>o1</symbol> the
object.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Look for a triple in the mapping model whose subject is
<symbol>p1</symbol> and whose predicate is
<symbol>rtm:maps-to</symbol>. If no such triple is found, move on to
the next triple of the input model. If more than one such triple is
found, select one arbitrarily and let <symbol>o2</symbol> be the
object of that predicate.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>If <symbol>s1</symbol> is a URI reference, get the topic
produced by the procedure in <xref linkend="sect-uri2topic"/> for that
URI reference and let it be known as <symbol>t1</symbol>.</para>
<para>If <symbol>s1</symbol> is a blank node, and it has not been
processed before, create a topic item to represent it and add it to
the [topics] property of the topic map item. If it has been processed
before, find the topic item created for it. Let this topic item be
known as <symbol>t1</symbol>.</para>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<para>Now follow the instructions in the section below whose name
corresponds to the value of <symbol>o2</symbol>. It is an error if
there is no such section, or if <symbol>o2</symbol> is a literal.
</para>
</listitem>
</orderedlist>

<section> <!-- BASENAME -->
<title><symbol>rtm:basename</symbol></title>

<para>
Create a topic name item and add it to the [topic names] property of
<symbol>t1</symbol>. Set its [value] property to the string value of
<symbol>o1</symbol>. It is an error if <symbol>o1</symbol> is not a
literal.
</para>

<para> 
Finally, let the topic name item be known as <symbol>c</symbol> and
follow the procedure in <xref linkend="sect-add-scope"/>.
Implementations which support typed names must also follow the
procedure in <xref linkend="sect-add-type"/>.
</para>
</section>

<section> <!-- OCCURRENCE -->
<title><symbol>rtm:occurrence</symbol></title>

<para>
Create an occurrence item and add it to the [occurrences] property of
<symbol>t1</symbol>. If <symbol>o1</symbol> is a literal, set its
[value] property to the string value of <symbol>o1</symbol>, otherwise
create a locator item and set its [notation] property to
<literal>"URI"</literal> and its [reference] property to 
<symbol>o1</symbol>, and set the locator as the value of the
occurrence item's [locator] property. It is an error if
<symbol>o1</symbol> is a blank node.
</para>

<para>
Finally, let the occurrence item be known as <symbol>c</symbol> and
follow the procedures in <xref linkend="sect-add-scope"/> and <xref
linkend="sect-add-type"/>.
</para>
</section>

<section> <!-- ASSOCIATION -->
<title><symbol>rtm:association</symbol></title>

<para>
Create an association item and add it to the [associations] property
of the topic map item. Let <symbol>t2</symbol> be the topic for
<symbol>o1</symbol>; it is an error if <symbol>o1</symbol> is a
literal.
</para>

<para>
Look for a triple in the mapping model whose subject is
<symbol>p1</symbol> and whose predicate is
<symbol>rtm:subject-role</symbol>; let <symbol>rt1</symbol> be the
object. It is an error if <symbol>rt1</symbol> is a blank node or a
literal. Create an association role item and add it to the [roles]
property of the association, set its [player] property to
<symbol>t1</symbol>, and its [type] property to the topic for
<symbol>rt1</symbol>.
</para>

<para>
Now look for a triple in the mapping model whose subject is
<symbol>p1</symbol> and whose predicate is
<symbol>rtm:object-role</symbol>; let <symbol>rt2</symbol> be the
object. It is an error if <symbol>rt2</symbol> is a blank node or a
literal. Create an association role item and add it to the [roles]
property of the association, set its [player] property to
<symbol>t2</symbol>, and its [type] property to the topic for
<symbol>rt2</symbol>.
</para>

<para>
Finally, let the association item be known as <symbol>c</symbol> and
follow the procedures in <xref linkend="sect-add-scope"/> and <xref
linkend="sect-add-type"/>.
</para>
</section>

<section> <!-- INSTANCE-OF -->
<title><symbol>rtm:instance-of</symbol></title>

<para>
Create an association item. Get the topic for
<literal>http://psi.topicmaps.org/sam/1.0/#type-instance</literal> and
put it in the [type] property of the association item.
</para>

<para>
Create an association role item. Get the topic for
<literal>http://psi.topicmaps.org/sam/1.0/#type</literal> and put it
in its [type] property. Get the topic for <symbol>o1</symbol> and put
it in the [player] property. It is an error if <symbol>o1</symbol> is
a literal.
</para>

<para>
Create an association role item. Get the topic for
<literal>http://psi.topicmaps.org/sam/1.0/#instance</literal> and put
it in its [type] property, and put <symbol>t1</symbol> in the [player]
property.
</para>

<para>
Finally, let the association item be known as <symbol>c</symbol> and
follow the procedure in <xref linkend="sect-add-type"/>.
</para>

<note>
<para>
The URIs used here are the ones given in the current draft of TMDM,
but they are unlikely to be the URIs in the final version. It is
recommended that implementations represent RDF statements mapped to
<symbol>instance-of</symbol> using their internal representation for
the <symbol>type-instance</symbol> relationship. This document will be
updated when TMDM is finalized.
</para>
</note>
</section>

<section> <!-- SUBJECT-IDENTIFIER -->
<title><symbol>rtm:subject-identifier</symbol></title>

<para>
Create a locator item and set its [notation] property to
<literal>"URI"</literal> and its [reference] property to
<symbol>o1</symbol>, then add it to the [subject identifiers] property
of <symbol>t1</symbol>. It is an error if <symbol>o1</symbol> is a
literal or a blank node.
</para>
</section>

<section> <!-- SUBJECT-LOCATOR -->
<title><symbol>rtm:subject-locator</symbol></title>

<para>
Create a locator item and set its [notation] property to
<literal>"URI"</literal> and its [reference] property to
<symbol>o1</symbol>, then set it as the value of the [subject locator]
property of <symbol>t1</symbol>. It is an error if <symbol>o1</symbol>
is a literal or a blank node, or if <symbol>t1</symbol> already has a
different value in its [subject locator] property.
</para>
</section>

<section> <!-- SOURCE-LOCATOR -->
<title><symbol>rtm:source-locator</symbol></title>

<para>
Create a locator item and set its [notation] property to
<literal>"URI"</literal> and its [reference] property to
<symbol>o1</symbol>, then add it to the [source locators] property of
<symbol>t1</symbol>. It is an error if <symbol>o1</symbol> is a
literal or a blank node.
</para>
</section>

<section id="sect-add-scope"> <!-- IN-SCOPE -->
<title>Adding scope</title>

<para>
For each triple whose subject is <symbol>p1</symbol> and whose
predicate is <symbol>rtm:in-scope</symbol>, get the topic for the
object of the triple and add it to the [scope] property of
<symbol>c</symbol>. It is an error if the object is a literal.
</para>
</section>

<section id="sect-add-type"> <!-- TYPE -->
<title>Adding type</title>

<para>
Look for a triple whose subject is <symbol>p1</symbol> and whose
predicate is <symbol>rtm:type</symbol>. If such a triple is found, get
the topic for the object of the triple and set it as the value of the
[type] property of <symbol>c</symbol>. It is an error if the object is
a literal.
</para>

<para>
If not such triple is found, get the topic for <symbol>p1</symbol> and
set it as the value of the [type] property of <symbol>c</symbol>.
</para>
</section>

<section id="sect-uri2topic">
<title>Getting a topic for a URI reference</title>

<para>
Look for a topic item whose [subject identifiers] property contains a
locator item whose [notation] property is <literal>"URI"</literal> and
whose [reference] property contains the URI reference. If no such
topic item is found, create one.
</para>
